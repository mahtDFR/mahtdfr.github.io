## Ultimaker
Since 2017 I have worked [Ultimaker](https://ultimaker.com), a leading desktop 3D printing company with offices in the Netherlands, USA, and Singapore. Ultimaker's mission is to accelerate the world's transition to local manufacturing and digital distribution. During my time here I have worked within the Marketing and R&D departments and have produced various forms of content to attract customers to the Ultimaker brand.

### Localization

In 2019 I worked on a project to translate Ultimaker.com's buying journey into [German](https://ultimaker.com/de/software/ultimaker-cura), [French](https://ultimaker.com/fr/software/ultimaker-cura), [Italian](https://ultimaker.com/it/software/ultimaker-cura), [Spanish](https://ultimaker.com/es/software/ultimaker-cura), [Korean](https://ultimaker.com/ko/software/ultimaker-cura), and [Japanese](https://ultimaker.com/ja/software/ultimaker-cura). This boosted Ultimaker's reach to thousands more customers all over the world.

### White papers

I have written and published several white papers about 3D printing technology to generate leads for Ultimaker's marketing automation platform.

## DFRobot

Between 2015 - 2017 I lived in Shanghai, where I worked at [DFRobot](https://www.dfrobot.com/) - a manufacturer of open source electronics catering to industry and STEM education. Besides maintaining keeping a product wiki up to date and tinkering with robots and 3D printers all day, I managed a community for their flagship product "[LattePanda](https://www.lattepanda.com/products/3.html)" - a powerful single board computer, which we successfully promoted through several influential channels.
